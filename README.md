# Microsoft REST API Guidelines
The [Microsoft REST API Guidelines](Guidelines.md), as a design principle, encourages application developers to have resources accessible to them via a RESTful HTTP interface. To provide the smoothest possible experience for developers on platforms following the Microsoft REST API Guidelines, REST APIs SHOULD follow [consistent design guidelines](Guidelines.md#7-consistency-fundamentals) to make using them easy and intuitive.
