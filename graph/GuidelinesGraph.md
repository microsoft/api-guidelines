## Introduction

When building a digital ecosystem API, usability becomes a business priority. The success of your ecosystem depends on APIs that are easy to discover, simple to use, fit for purpose, and consistent across your products.

This document offers guidance that Microsoft Graph API producer teams MUST follow to
ensure that Microsoft Graph has a consistent and easy-to-use API surface. A new API design should meet the following goals:

- Be developer friendly by using consistent naming, patterns, and web standards (HTTP, REST, JSON).

- Work well with SDKs in many programming languages.

- Be sustainable and evolvable by using clear API contracts.

The Microsoft Graph REST API Guidelines are an extension of the
[Microsoft REST API Guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines/). It is assumed that readers are following the Microsoft REST API Guidelines except where this document outlines specific differences or exceptions to those guidelines. Together, these guidelines and a library of API patterns serve as the means by which API teams discuss and come to consensus on API review requirements.

Technology and software are constantly changing and evolving, and as such, this
is intended to be a living document. API guidelines that change frequently lead to an uneven and inconsistent API surface. Consequently, this document will frequently change to add guidance in areas previously uncovered or to clarify existing guidance. It will less frequently change the directional guidance it has already provided. To suggest a change or propose a new idea,
[open an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines/issues/new/choose).

### Legend

This document offers prescriptive guidance labeled as follows:

:heavy_check_mark: **MUST** satisfy this specification.

:no_entry: **MUST NOT** use this pattern.

:ballot_box_with_check: **SHOULD** fulfill this specification.

:warning: **SHOULD NOT** adopt this pattern.

If you do not follow this advice, you MUST disclose your reasons during the Microsoft Graph API review.

## Design approach

The design of your API is arguably the most important investment you will make. API design is what creates the first impression for developers when they discover and learn how to use your APIs. We promote an API-first design approach where you begin your product design by focusing on how information is exchanged and represented and by creating an interface contract for your API, which is followed by design and implementation of the backing service. This approach ensures decoupling of the interface from your implementation and is essential for agility, predictability, and reuse of your APIs.

An established interface contract allows developers to use your API while internal teams are still working on implementation; API specifications enable designing user experience and test cases in parallel. Starting with user-facing contracts also promotes a good understanding of system interactions, your modeling domain, and an understanding of how the service will evolve.

Microsoft Graph supports resource and query-based API styles that follow HTTP, REST, and JSON standards, where the API contract is described by using OData conventions and schema definitions. For more information, see [Documentation · OData Version 4.01](https://www.odata.org/documentation/).

In general, API design includes the following steps:

1. Outline the key current and future scenarios for API consumers.
  
1. Define your domain model.

1. Derive and name your API resources.
  
1. Describe relationships between resources.

1. Determine required behavior.

1. Determine user roles and application permissions.

1. Specify errors.

When creating your API contract, you define resources based on the domain model supporting your service and identify interactions based on user scenarios. Good API design goes beyond modeling the current state of resources. It is important to plan ahead how the API evolves; to do this, it is essential to understand and document your user scenarios as the foundation of the API design. There is no one-to-one correspondence between domain model elements and API resources because you should simplify your customer facing APIs for better usability and to obfuscate implementation details.

We recommend creating a simple resource diagram like the following to show resources and their relationships and make it easier to reason about modeling choices and the shape of your API.

![Resource model example](ModelExample.png)

After you define your resources, it’s time to think about the behavior of your API, which can be expressed via HTTP methods and operational resources such as functions and actions. As you think about API behavior, you identify a happy path and various exceptions and deviations that will be expressed as errors and represented by using HTTP codes and error messages.

At every step of your design, you need to consider security, privacy, and compliance as intrinsic components of your API implementation.

### Naming

API resources are typically described by nouns. Resource and property names appear in API URLs and payloads and must be descriptive and easy to understand. Ease of understanding comes from familiarity and recognition; therefore, when thinking about naming, you should favor consistency with other Microsoft Graph APIs, names in the product user interface, and industry standards. Microsoft Graph naming conventions follow the [Microsoft REST API naming guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/vNext/Guidelines.md#17-naming-guidelines).

Following is a short summary of the most often used conventions.

| Requirements                                                            | Example                       |

### Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)

A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is how developers access the resources of your API.

Navigation paths to Microsoft Graph resources are generally broken into multiple segments,
`{scheme}://{host}/{version}/{category}/[{pathSegment}][?{query}]` where:

- `scheme` and `host` segments are always [`https://graph.microsoft.com`](https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users).

- `version` can be v1.0 or beta.

- `category` is a logical grouping of APIs into top-level categories.

- `pathSegment` is one or many navigation segments that can address an entity, collection of entities, property, or operation available for an entity.

- `query` string must follow the OData standard for query representations and is covered in the Query section of OData specifications.

While HTTP defines no constraints on how different resources are related, it does encourage the use of URL path segment hierarchies to convey relationships. In Microsoft Graph, relationships between resources are supported by the OData concepts of singletons, entity sets, entities, complex types, and navigation properties.

In Microsoft Graph, a top-level API category might represent one of the following groupings:

- A core *user-centric concept* of Microsoft Graph: /users, /groups, or /me.

- A Microsoft *product or service offering* covering multiple use cases: /teamwork, /directory.

- A *feature offering* covering a single use case and *shared* across multiple Microsoft products: /search, /notifications, /subscriptions.

- *Administrative configuration* functions for specific products: /admin/exchange.

- Internal Microsoft requirements for publishing Privileged and Hidden APIs, routing, and load testing: /loadTestEntities.

Effectively, top-level categories define a perimeter for the API surface; thus, a new category creation requires additional rigor and governance approval.

### Query support

Microsoft Graph APIs should support basic query options in conformance with OData specifications and [Microsoft REST API Guidelines for error condition responses](https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/vNext/Guidelines.md#7102-error-condition-responses).

|Requirements                                                                                        |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| :heavy_check_mark: **MUST** support `$select on resource` to enable properties projection. |
| :ballot_box_with_check: **SHOULD** support `/entityTypeCollection/{id}?$expand=navProp1` option for navigation properties of entities. |
| :ballot_box_with_check: **SHOULD** support `$filter` with `eq` and `ne` operations on properties of entity collections. |
| :heavy_check_mark: **MUST** support [server-driven pagination](https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/vNext/Guidelines.md#981-server-driven-paging) of collections using a [nextLink](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata-json-format/v4.01/odata-json-format-v4.01.html#sec_ControlInformationnextLinkodatanextL).  |
| :ballot_box_with_check: **SHOULD** support [client-driven pagination](https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/vNext/Guidelines.md#982-client-driven-paging) of collections using `$top` and `$skip` (or `$skipToken`). |
| :ballot_box_with_check: **SHOULD** support `$count` for collections. |
| :ballot_box_with_check: **SHOULD** support sorting with `$orderby` both ascending and descending on properties of the entities. |

The query options part of an OData URL can be quite long, potentially exceeding the maximum length of URLs supported by components involved in transmitting or processing the request. One way to avoid this is to use the POST verb instead of GET with the `$query` segment, and pass the query options part of the URL in the request body as described in the chapter
[OData Query Options](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.01/odata-v4.01-part2-url-conventions.html#sec_PassingQueryOptionsintheRequestBody).

Another way to avoid this is to use JSON batch as described in the [Microsoft Graph batching documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/json-batching#bypassing-url-length-limitations-with-batching).

### Resource modeling patterns

You can model structured resources for your APIs by using the OData entity type or complex type. The main difference between these types is that an entity type declares a key property to uniquely identify its objects, and a complex type does not. In Microsoft Graph, this key property is called `id` for server-created key values. If there is a natural name for the key property, then the workload can use that.

Because objects of complex types in Microsoft Graph don’t have unique identifiers, they are not directly addressable via URIs. Therefore, you must use entity types to model addressable resources such as individually addressable items within a collection. For more information, see the [Microsoft REST API Guidelines collection URL patterns](https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/vNext/Guidelines.md#93-collection-url-patterns). Complex types are better suited to represent composite properties of API entities.

```xml
 <EntityType Name="author">
    <Key>
        <PropertyRef Name="id" />
    </Key>
    <Property Name="id" Type="Edm.String" Nullable="false" />
    <Property Name="name" Type="Edm.String" />
    <Property Name="address" Type="microsoft.graph.Address" />
</EntityType>
<ComplexType Name="address">
    <Property Name="city" Type="Edm.String" />
    <Property Name="street" Type="Edm.String" />
    <Property Name="stateOrProvince" Type="Edm.String" />
    <Property Name="country" Type="Edm.String" />
</ComplexType>
```

|  Microsoft Graph rules for modeling complex resources                                       |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| :heavy_check_mark: **MUST** use String type for ID.                                         |
| :heavy_check_mark: **MUST** use a primary key composed of a single property.                |
| :heavy_check_mark: **MUST** use an object as the root of all JSON payloads.                 |
| :heavy_check_mark: **MUST** use a root object with a value property to return a collection. |
| :heavy_check_mark: **MUST** include @odata.type annotations when the type is ambiguous.     |
| :warning: **SHOULD NOT** add the property ID to a complex type.                             |

There are different approaches for designing an API resource model in situations with multiple variants of a common concept.
The three most often used patterns in Microsoft Graph today are type hierarchy, facets, and flat bag of properties:

- **[Type hierarchy](./patterns/subtypes.md)** is represented by one abstract base type with a few common properties and one subtype for each variant.

- **[Facets](./patterns/facets.md)** are represented by a single entity type with common properties and one facet property (of complex type) per variant. The facet properties only have a value when the object represents that variant.

- **[Flat bag of properties](./patterns/flat-bag.md)** is represented by one entity type with all the potential properties plus an additional property to distinguish the variants, often called type. The type property describes the variant and also defines properties that are required or meaningful for the variant given by the type property.

The following table shows a summary of the main qualities for each pattern and can help you select a pattern fit for your use case.

| API qualities\patterns  | Properties and behavior described in metadata | Supports combinations of properties and behaviors | Simple query construction |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Type hierarchy          | yes                                           | no                                                | no                        |
| Facets                  | partially                                     | yes                                               | yes                       |
| Flat bag                | no                                            | no                                                | yes                       |

#### Pros and cons

Following are a few pros and cons to decide which pattern to use:

- In **[hierarchy](./patterns/subtypes.md)**, the interdependencies of properties, that is, which properties are relevant for which variants, is fully captured in metadata, and client code can potentially leverage that to construct and/or validate requests.

- Introducing new cases in **hierarchy** is relatively isolated (which is why it is so familiar to OOP) and is considered backwards compatible (at least syntactically).

- Introducing new cases/variants in **[facets](./patterns/facets.md)** is straightforward. You need to be careful because it can introduce situations where previously only one of the facets was non-null and now all the old ones are null. This is not unlike adding new subtypes in the **hierarchy** pattern or adding a new type value in the **[flat bag](./patterns/flat-bag.md)** pattern.

- **hierarchy** and **facets** (to a slightly lesser degree) are well-suited for strongly typed client programming languages, whereas **flat bag** is more familiar to developers of less strongly typed languages.

- **facets** has the potential to model what is typically associated with multiple inheritance. 

- **facets** and **flat bag** lend to syntactically simpler filter query expression. **hierarchy** is more explicit but requires the cast segments in the filter query.

- **hierarchy** can be refined by annotating the collections with OData derived type constraints; see [validation vocabulary](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/Org.OData.Validation.V1.md). This annotation restricts the values to certain sub-trees of an inheritance **hierarchy**. It makes it very explicit that the collection only contains elements of some of the subtypes and helps to not return objects of a type that are semantically not suitable.

> **Note:**
> As can be seen in a few of the pros and cons, one of the important aspects discussed here is that the API design goes beyond the syntactical aspects of the API. Therefore, it is important to plan ahead how the API evolves, lay the foundation, and allow users to form a good understanding of the semantics of the API. **Changing the semantics is always a breaking change.** The different modeling patterns differ in how they express syntax and semantics and how they allow the API to evolve without breaking compatibility. For more information, see [API contract and non-backward compatible changes](#api-contract-and-non-backward-compatible-changes) later in this article.

#### Nullable properties

The facet and flat bag approaches often require nullable properties, so it is important to still use non-nullable properties where appropriate. Since inheritance can often remove the use of nullable properties completely, it is also important to know when nullable properties are necessary. See [Nullable properties](./nullable.md) for more details.
### Behavior modeling

The HTTP operations dictate how your API behaves. The URL of an API, along with its request/response bodies, establishes the overall contract that developers have with your service. As an API provider, how you manage the overall request/response pattern should be one of the first implementation decisions you make.

If possible, APIs SHOULD use resource-based designs with standard HTTP methods rather than operation resources. Operation resources are either functions or actions. According to [OData standards](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/errata03/os/complete/part3-csdl/odata-v4.0-errata03-os-part3-csdl-complete.html#_The_edm:Function_Element_2), a function represents an operation that returns a single instance or collection of instances of any type and doesn’t have an observable side effect. An action might have side effects and might return a result represented as a single entity or collection of any type.

|  Microsoft Graph rules for modeling behavior                     |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| :heavy_check_mark: **MUST** use POST to create new entities in insertable entity sets or collections.<BR>This approach requires the server to produce system generated identities. |
| :heavy_check_mark: **MUST** use PATCH to edit updatable resources.  |
| :heavy_check_mark: **MUST** use DELETE to delete deletable resources. |
| :heavy_check_mark: **MUST** use GET for listing and reading resources. |
| :warning: **SHOULD NOT** use PUT for updating resources. |
| :ballot_box_with_check: **SHOULD** avoid using multiple round trips to complete a single logical operation. |

Operation resources must have a binding parameter that matches the type of the bound resource. In addition, both actions and functions support overloading, meaning an API definition might contain multiple actions or functions with the same name.

For a complete list of standard HTTP operations, see the [Microsoft REST API Guidelines error condition responses](https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/vNext/Guidelines.md#7102-error-condition-responses).

### Error handling

Microsoft REST API Guidelines provide guidelines that Microsoft Graph APIs should follow when returning error condition responses. You can improve API traceability and consistency by using the recommended Microsoft Graph error model and the Microsoft Graph utilities library to provide a standard implementation for your service:

```http
{
"error": {
    "code": "badRequest",
    "message": "Cannot process the request because a required field is missing.",
    "target": "query",    
    "innererror": {
                "code": "requiredFieldMissing",
                           
                }
    }
}
```

The top-level error code must be aligned with HTTP response status codes according to [rfc7231 (ietf.org)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-6). The following examples demonstrate error modeling for common use cases:

- **Simple error**: An API wants to report an error with top-level details only. The error object contains the top-level error code, message and target (optional).

   ```http
    {
      "error": {
        "code": "badRequest",
        "message": "Cannot process the request because it is malformed or incorrect.",
    	"target": "resource X (Optional)"
      }
    }
   ```

- **Detailed error**: An API needs to provide service-specific details of the error via the innererror property of the error object. It is intended to allow services to supply a specific error code to help differentiate errors that share the same top-level error code but are reported for different reasons.
    
   ```http
    {
      "error": {
        "code": "badRequest",
        "message": "Cannot process the request because it is malformed or incorrect.",
        "innererror": {
          "code": "requiredFieldOrParameterMissing",
               
        }
      }
    }
   ```

| Microsoft Graph enforces the following error rules                                                                | 
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| :heavy_check_mark: **MUST** return an error property with a child code property in all error responses. |
| :heavy_check_mark: **MUST** return a 403 Forbidden error when the application or signed-in user has insufficient permissions present in the auth token. |
| :heavy_check_mark: **MUST** return a 429 Too Many Requests error when the client exceeded throttling limits, and a 503 Service Unavailable error when the service overloaded but the client is within throttling limits.|
| :ballot_box_with_check: **SHOULD** return a 404 Not Found error if a 403 error would result in information disclosure. |

For a complete mapping of error codes to HTTP statuses, see
[rfc7231 (ietf.org)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-6).

## API contract and non-backward compatible changes

The Microsoft Graph definition of breaking changes is based on the
[Microsoft REST API Guidelines definition of a breaking change](https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/vNext/Guidelines.md#123-definition-of-a-breaking-change). In general, making all but additive changes to the API contract for existing elements is considered breaking. Adding new elements is allowed and is not considered a breaking change.

**Non-breaking changes:**

- Adding properties that are nullable or have a default value
- Adding a member after the sentinel member to an evolvable enumeration
- Removing, renaming, or changing the type of annotation
- Changing the order of properties
- Changing the length or format of opaque strings, such as resource IDs
- Adding or removing an annotation OpenType="true"

**Breaking changes:**

- Changing the URL or fundamental request/response associated with a resource
- Removing, renaming, or changing an incompatible type of a declared property
- Removing or renaming APIs or API parameters
- Adding a required request header
- Adding EnumType members for non-evolvable enumerations
- Adding Nullable="false" properties to existing types
- Adding a parameter not marked as [Nullable](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata-csdl-xml/v4.01/odata-csdl-xml-v4.01.html#sec_Nullable) to existing actions
- Adding a parameter not marked as [Optional](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/Org.OData.Core.V1.md#OptionalParameter) to an existing function
- Changing top-level error codes
- Introducing server-side pagination to existing collections
- Making significant changes to the performance of APIs such as increased latency, rate limits, or concurrency

### Versioning and deprecation

As the market and technology evolves, your APIs will require modifications. In this case, you must avoid breaking changes and add new resources and features incrementally. If that is not possible, then you must version elements of your APIs. Microsoft Graph allows versioning of elements, including entities and properties. Versioning involves adding a new, uniquely named version of the element and marking the old version as deprecated.

In some cases, there is a natural new name for the element. In other cases, where the original name is still the most descriptive, the suffix _v2 can be added to the original name to make it unique. The original element is then marked as deprecated by using annotations.

Microsoft Graph provides two public endpoints to support the API lifecycle:
- [API sets on the v1.0 endpoint](https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0) are in general availability (GA) status.
- [API sets on the beta endpoint](https://graph.microsoft.com/beta) are in beta or private preview status.

Microsoft Graph APIs in the GA version guarantee API stability and consistency for its clients. If your API requires a breaking change in GA, then you MUST create new element versions and support deprecated elements for a minimum of 36 months or 24 months with demonstrated non-usage.

On the beta endpoint, breaking changes and deprecation of APIs are allowed with consideration of dependencies and customer impact. It is a best practice to test new element versions on the beta endpoint at first and then promote API changes to the GA endpoint.

Detailed requirements for versioning and deprecation are described in the [Deprecation guidelines](./deprecation.md).

## Recommended API design patterns

The guidelines in previous sections are intentionally brief and provide a jump start for Microsoft Graph API developers. More detailed design guidance about REST APIs is published at the [Microsoft REST API Guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines/). Microsoft Graph-specific patterns are outlined in the following table.

| Pattern                                          | Description                                                                |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Alternate key](./patterns/alternate-key.md)     | Uniquely identify and query resources using an alternate key.              |
| [Change tracking](./patterns/change-tracking.md) | Keep API consumers in sync with changes without polling.                   |
| [Collection subsets](./patterns/subsets.md) | Model collection subsets   |
| [Dictionary](./patterns/dictionary.md)           | Clients can provide an unknown quantity of data elements of the same type. |
| [Evolvable enums](./patterns/evolvable-enums.md) | Extend enumerated types without breaking changes.                          |
| [Facets](./patterns/facets.md)                   | Model parent-child relationships.                                          |
| [Flat bag](./patterns/flat-bag.md)               | Model variants of the same type.                                           |
| [Long running operations](./patterns/longRunningOperations.md)| Model operations where processing a client request takes a long time. |
| [Modeling subsets](./patterns/subsets.md)        | Model collection subsets for All, None, Included, or Excluded criteria.    |
| [Namespace](./patterns/namespace.md)             | Organize resource definitions into a logical set.                          |
| [Navigation properties](./patterns/navigation-property.md) | Model resource relationships                         |
| [Operations](./patterns/operations.md) | Model complex business operations                          |
| [Type hierarchy](./patterns/subtypes.md)         | Model `is-a` relationships using subtypes.                                 |
